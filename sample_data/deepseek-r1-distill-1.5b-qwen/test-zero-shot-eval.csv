is proposing to eliminate this tax shelter. If the sale of your
Home is taxed as income and your taxable is gain is more than
$222,420, you will be taxed at 53.50%. If you are over 65 you
would also lose your Old Age Security benefit for the entire

Policy Proposal 2: Housing Affordability
Housing Affordability
Adam Vaughan
Theme: Affordable Home
Ownership
Date: November 27, 2018
1. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
What is the problem / opportunity we're trying to solve? Describe briefly, 1 sentence.
Help first time home buyers purchase housing
What evidence substantiates this concern? Briefly provide several important facts, with reference to key
sources.
People trying to buy their first home have had barriers put in place by government worried about high rates
of personal debt, additionally in some urban areas market forces have pushed prices beyond the reach of
Canadians and in particular first time buyers
2. APPROACH AND IMPACT
What did we say in the 2015 platform (if anything)?
We promised a National Housing Strategy that would address both the need for Affordable Housing and
Housing Affordability.
What have we done since? What impact has this had? While we have made substantial investments and
developed policy to to support people who need affordable housing, most off these initiatives have
supported below market access to rental housing for people who demonstrate core housing need. At the
same time we have introduced stress tests to screen out high risk mortgages. This and volatile market
forces in certain urban centres has created a situation where young Canadians and in certainly young
families are worried that they will never be able to own their own home.
Proposed new initiative: Describe in a couple sentences how the proposal would work, the outcome it
would have, and how it addresses the main problem. This should be written in people-oriented language.
A combination of tax measures, changes to mortgage rules and investment tools that support and stimulate
savings for first time buyers is seen as the best way forward. We have to be very careful not to project too
much capital into the market all at once. This increase risk and would likely stimulate inflation. We need to
avoid a situation where good money chases bad.
TAX: Increasing the capital gains of speculation to remove multiple buyers from the market, restricting
foreign investment to new construction and restricting the capacity of off shore capital to enter the re-sell
market could reduce inflation. This might be achieved by significantly increasing Capital Gains Tax on 2nd,
3rd and 4th properties.
Campaign Platform 2019
Another idea that has emerged from housing town halls is a sliding scale on the Capital Gains Tax on the
sale of principle residences. A 50% tax after one year of ownership, 25% after two years, 15% after 3
years, 10% after 4 years, 5% after five. The idea would be to hit speculators who quickly flip houses in hot
markets. The funds could be invested back into enhanced co

Pray for Gomes! Everyone blesses him... And should Son be blamed or forgiven?

Everton midfielder Andre Gomes will have surgery on Monday after suffering a horrific ankle injury in Sunday's Premier League match against Tottenham.

The Portuguese was taken straight to hospital where he has been diagnosed with a fracture dislocation to his right ankle.

A distressed Son Heung-min of Spurs was sent off in the 79th minute for the tackle on the Portuguese player.

There was a six-minute stoppage as medics tended to Gomes.

The incident looked innocuous, but the mood changed among the players and crowd after they saw the full impact.

The match eventually finished 1-1 after Cenk Tosun's header in the 97th minute cancelled out Dele Alli's earlier effort.

'More than a football game'

Everton boss Silva backed Gomes, 26, to return stronger and also praised his players for their response.

""This is a bad moment for us and our team - this was more than a football game,"" he said. ""We will give all support to Andre and his family. As a group we have to stay together and show the spirit we showed following the incident.

""Our players now, they are sad, a tough moment for us in our dressing room and for Andre, but the spirit we showed after that moment on the pitch I think is a good answer for you.

""He is seriously injured but I am 100% sure Andre will become stronger as a football player and as a man, because he is a fantastic lad, a fantastic professional.""

The injury overshadowed the game in which Toffees substitute Tosun equalised in injury time.

""Everybody is sad inside. Some players, they nearly cried,"" said Tosun, who had been on the pitch just 10 minutes.

""He was in shock, his eyes were open so big. He was like crying, shouting and screaming.

""I just tried to hold him and speak to him. I tried to tell him to stay calm. We couldn't understand him.""

Tosun added on Instagram later: ""You win, you draw, you lose but all that doesn't matter when something like this happens.""

""I wish I didn't score, I wish we lost 0-5 and this didn't happen. I know you will come back stronger bro and we will be there for you.""

Everton midfielder Fabian Delph appeared to still be affected in a post-match TV interview when asked about his team-mate.

""He's one our brothers, someone we care about deeply,"" said the former Manchester City player. ""It's hard to put into words. The sooner we can get in touch the better. That was difficult to see.""

'Son can't lift his head up'

The TV replay suggested that Gomes suffered the injury after Son's tackle and before he collided with full-back Serge Aurier.

Goalscorer Alli said he found Son crying in the changing room after the final whistle.

""I didn't want to look too much at what happened,"" said the England midfielder. ""I want to send Andre my best wishes.

""Son is devastated and in tears - it's not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you've ever met. He can't even lift his head up, he's crying so much.

""The injury does play on your mind during the match but you have to stay professional.""

Former Toffees midfielder Pat Nevin, who was a summariser for BBC Radio 5 Live at Goodison Park, described the events in the immediate aftermath of the injury.

""This is horrible, horrible,"" said the Scot. ""The players look devastated and there is utter confusion here. Players with their heads in their hands.

""Son deliberately tackles Gomes, but he does not cause that [the injury]. He is catapulted from that challenge on to Aurier. To blame Son and to say he did that deliberately is 100% wrong. Son is not like that, he is not that kind of guy.

""He does not deserve the treatment he is going to get on social media. He is devastated - he was the cause, but it was not his fault. It's just one of those things that happens in football.""

'The players from Everton were fantastic'

Referee Martin Atkinson initially showed Son a yellow card before he changed it to red.

The Premier League explained: ""The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player, which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge.""

Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino insists the forward had no intention of injuring Gomes and believes VAR should have rescinded the sending-off.

""It was clear it was never the intention of Son to create the problem that happened afterwards. It is unbelievable to see a red card,"" he said.

""In that situation we need to help because the decision of the referee was yellow card but the VAR changed the decision. It is the latest example of it being not clear.

""VAR needs to check if it was a bad tackle from Son and judge the action not what happened after.

""We all feel sorry for Andre. I want to send my best wishes to him and to his family in this tough moment. We want to send, on behalf of the squad, our best wishes.""

Pochettino also revealed that Everton's club captain Seamus Coleman, who was out for a year after suffering a double-fracture of his lower leg in March 2017, spoke to Son afterwards.

""The players from Everton were fantastic. The captain came to the dressing room to console Son,"" said the Argentine.

""I want to say thank you to the players and Coleman, who came in on behalf of the squad of Everton.""

Pochettino also revealed that Everton's club captain Seamus Coleman, who was out for a year after suffering a double-fracture of his lower leg in March 2017, spoke to Son afterwards.

""The players from Everton were fantastic. The captain came to the dressing room to console Son,"" said the Argentine.

""I want to say thank you to the players and Coleman, who came in on behalf of the squad of Everton.""

Football world send best wishes to Gomes Pray for Gomes! Everyone blesses him... And should Son be blamed or forgiven?

Everton midfielder Andre Gomes will have surgery on Monday after suffering a horrific ankle injury in Sunday's Premier League match against Tottenham.

The Portuguese was taken straight to hospital where he has been diagnosed with a fracture dislocation to his right ankle.

A distressed Son Heung-min of Spurs was sent off in the 79th minute for the tackle on the Portuguese player.

There was a six-minute stoppage as medics tended to Gomes.

The incident looked innocuous, but the mood changed among the players and crowd after they saw the full impact.

The match eventually finished 1-1 after Cenk Tosun's header in the 97th minute cancelled out Dele Alli's earlier effort.

'More than a football game'

Everton boss Silva backed Gomes, 26, to return stronger and also praised his players for their response.

""This is a bad moment for us and our team - this was more than a football game,"" he said. ""We will give all support to Andre and his family. As a group we have to stay together and show the spirit we showed following the incident.

""Our players now, they are sad, a tough moment for us in our dressing room and for Andre, but the spirit we showed after that moment on the pitch I think is a good answer for you.

""He is seriously injured but I am 100% sure Andre will become stronger as a football player and as a man, because he is a fantastic lad, a fantastic professional.""

The injury overshadowed the game in which Toffees substitute Tosun equalised in injury time.

""Everybody is sad inside. Some players, they nearly cried,"" said Tosun, who had been on the pitch just 10 minutes.

""He was in shock, his eyes were open so big. He was like crying, shouting and screaming.

""I just tried to hold him and speak to him. I tried to tell him to stay calm. We couldn't understand him.""

Tosun added on Instagram later: ""You win, you draw, you lose but all that doesn't matter when something like this happens.""

""I wish I didn't score, I wish we lost 0-5 and this didn't happen. I know you will come back stronger bro and we will be there for you.""

Everton midfielder Fabian Delph appeared to still be affected in a post-match TV interview when asked about his team-mate.

""He's one our brothers, someone we care about deeply,"" said the former Manchester City player. ""It's hard to put into words. The sooner we can get in touch the better. That was difficult to see.""

'Son can't lift his head up'

The TV replay suggested that Gomes suffered the injury after Son's tackle and before he collided with full-back Serge Aurier.

Goalscorer Alli said he found Son crying in the changing room after the final whistle.

""I didn't want to look too much at what happened,"" said the England midfielder. ""I want to send Andre my best wishes.

""Son is devastated and in tears - it's not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you've ever met. He can't even lift his head up, he's crying so much.

""The injury does play on your mind during the match but you have to stay professional.""

Former Toffees midfielder Pat Nevin, who was a summariser for BBC Radio 5 Live at Goodison Park, described the events in the immediate aftermath of the injury.

""This is horrible, horrible,"" said the Scot. ""The players look devastated and there is utter confusion here. Players with their heads in their hands.

""Son deliberately tackles Gomes, but he does not cause that [the injury]. He is catapulted from that challenge on to Aurier. To blame Son and to say he did that deliberately is 100% wrong. Son is not like that, he is not that kind of guy.

""He does not deserve the treatment he is going to get on social media. He is devastated - he was the cause, but it was not his fault. It's just one of those things that happens in football.""

'The players from Everton were fantastic'

Referee Martin Atkinson initially showed Son a yellow card before he changed it to red.

The Premier League explained: ""The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player, which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge.""

Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino insists the forward had no intention of injuring Gomes and believes VAR should have rescinded the sending-off.

""It was clear it was never the intention of Son to create the problem that happened afterwards. It is unbelievable to see a red card,"" he said.

""In that situation we need to help because the decision of the referee was yellow card but the VAR changed the decision. It is the latest example of it being not clear.

""VAR needs to check if it was a bad tackle from Son and judge the action not what happened after.

""We all feel sorry for Andre. I want to send my best wishes to him and to his family in this tough moment. We want to send, on behalf of the squad, our best wishes.""

Pochettino also revealed that Everton's club captain Seamus Coleman, who was out for a year after suffering a double-fracture of his lower leg in March 2017, spoke to Son afterwards.

""The players from Everton were fantastic. The captain came to the dressing room to console Son,"" said the Argentine.

""I want to say thank you to the players and Coleman, who came in on behalf of the squad of Everton.""

Kenyan man kills his 4-month-old son after doubting his paternity (graphic video)Police has arrested a 23-year-old man, Mark Njuguna, for allegedly killing his four-month-old son in Gatanga Murang‚Äôa, Kenya.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS
Last evening dining out with friends, one of their uncles, who's graduated with a master's degree and who worked in Shenzhen Hospital (Guangdong Province, China) sent him the following notes on Coronavirus for guidance:
1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Can't emphasise enough - drink plenty of water!
THE SYMPTOMS
1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.

Just to be clear scientifically, it is the vaccinated NOT the
unvaccinated spreading the mutant variants. This is from inoculating
during the pandemic with a poor neutralizing ""vaccine"". This is what
has happened with numerous other ""leaky"" (non-neutralizing)
vaccines. The classic example of this is Marek's disease in chickens.
I warned the CDC of this in April of this year. Other scientists warned
the CDC as well as similar scientific entities world-wide, months
earlier. Yet here we are. So please spare me the propaganda that the
unvaccinated are the ones "" causing"" this because they are not and
there is a clearly defined mechanistic pathway for how the
vaccinated are creating the mutants. The solution would be to STOP
vaccinating with these terrible GTs and start treating everyone at
high risk and those not at high risk who are symptomatic with cheap
safe and effective hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin until the virus
is driven out. This would stop the binding, replication and
transmission of the virus as well as ameliorate some pathogenic
processes due to spike in the vaxxed. Oh and it would cost virtually
nothing... and therein lies the problem!","The essential primary claim is that vaccination is causing the spread of mutant variants, exemplified by Marek's disease in chickens, and that stopping ineffective vaccines and promoting safe treatments would solve the problem.","Covid-19 vaccine recipients are spreading variants and ""creating"" mutations"

It's not ""SADS"". That's a bunch of bullshit. It's adverse reactions to the covid vaccine. I don't know how much more clear that can be. They release a new experimental vaccine and mandate it for everyone. Now *suddenly"" people are dying in their sleep and they don't know why.... put 2 and 2 together! And they're not only dying in their sleep. People are dropping all over the world of heart failure and heart issues. You can see that just in the sports industry alone. Not only that, still births, miscarriages, irregular menstral cycles, babies dying after birth, ""SIDS"", they are approving heart medication for children because they are also having heart attacks, Guillian Barre Syndrome. There's so much more then that. They won't tell you on your tv news channels. Pfizer was ordered to release documents on their vaccine that them and the FDA wanted hidden for 75 years. For the rest of our lifetimes!! Why!?? In the most recent dump of documents it shows they know that these vaccines are hurting babies and pregnant women. Infact they excluded pregnant women from all trials. Then they decided the vaccine was safe for all pregnant women off of a study they did on 42 rats for 44 days! That's how they decided that this Pfizer covid 19 vaccine was safe fo all pregnant women.The people who did these studies were employees of Pfizer! Now this Sudden Adult Death Syndrome !!?! Come on, have you ever heard of this bullshit before? Yeah SIDS we've heard of that, and that's bullshit too. It's an excuse for adverse reactions to vaccines in newborns. The only thing that has changed for this to have a sudden rise around the world in adults is this fucking vaccine. Whether you want to believe what I'm spewing off is fake or not... the fact is, this is coming straight from court ordered documents from Pfizer themselves. Documents the FDA did not want anyone to see until long after we're all gone.

That's a bunch of bullshit. It's adverse reactions to the covid vaccine. I don't know how much more clear that can be. They release a new experimental vaccine and mandate it for everyone. Now *suddenly"" people are dying in their sleep and they don't know why.... put 2 and 2 together! And they're not only dying in their sleep. People are dropping all over the world of heart failure and heart issues. You can see that just in the sports industry alone. Not only that, still births, miscarriages, irregular menstral cycles, babies dying after birth, ""SIDS"", they are approving heart medication for children because they are also having heart attacks, Guillian Barre Syndrome. There's so much more then that. They won't tell you on your tv news channels. Pfizer was ordered to release documents on their vaccine that them and the FDA wanted hidden for 75 years. For the rest of our lifetimes!! Why!?? In the most recent dump of documents it shows they know that these vaccines are hurting babies and pregnant women. Infact they excluded pregnant women from all trials. Then they decided the vaccine was safe for all pregnant women off of a study they did on 42 rats for 44 days! That's how they decided that this Pfizer covid 19 vaccine was safe fo all pregnant women.The people who did these studies were employees of Pfizer! Now this Sudden Adult Death Syndrome !!?! Come on, have you ever heard of this bullshit before? Yeah SIDS we've heard of that, and that's bullshit too. It's an excuse for adverse reactions to vaccines in newborns. The only thing that has changed for this to have a sudden rise around the world in adults is this fucking vaccine.

What is the essential primary claim being made in the following text?

Copied :  Yall can call me crazy all day... but you can‚Äôt tell me this doesn‚Äôt make you feel some kinda way üòü The Floyd event was staged. I‚Äôm not saying racism doesn‚Äôt exist but hear me out.  Staged Event?   These officers were involved with something, I‚Äôm not sure exactly what, but something is just not adding up. I think there is at the very least the ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù, that this was a filmed public execution of a black man by a white cop, with the purpose of creating racial tensions and driving a wedge in the growing group of anti deep state sentiment from comon people, that have already been psychologically traumatized by Covid 19 fears.  Historically, in  election years and in politically contested areas or in groups, racial or gun violence incidents are becoming common place.  Considering the rising approval rating of President Trump in the black community, an event like this was unfortunately ‚ÄúPredictable‚Äù Consider these points and contrast them to every other police brutality incident you've ever seen. The filmed portion of the incident was about 10 minutes long.   In that amount of time, three officers are holding one handcuffed man down. You only know that because of the pictures taken from across the street. You can't see the other two officers in the video because they are behind the vehicle.  During 8 minutes of the entire video, the officer has his knee on George Floyd's neck, which is not taught or approved by any law enforcement agency.  Additionally, other than the Asian officer speaking occasionally to the crowd of bystanders, there is no communication from any of the officers to Mr. Floyd.  No talking, no shouting.  When have you ever seen a police brutality video without police shouting? Additionally, the police had no goal.  They weren't trying to subdue him for arrest, he was already handcuffed and all they needed to do, was place him in the back of the car.  There is no plausible explanation for taking him to the ground and having three men on top of a handcuffed man, a knee placed on his neck.  Mr. Floyd presented no threat and was not resisting.   The only goal that there appeared to be was exactly what happened: ‚ÄúTo be filmed brutally killing a black man‚Äù.  Think about this, these officers did not care about being filmed, in fact the officer stared into the camera with soulless eyes and an emotionless face, reminiscent of an assassin, as he knowingly killed an American Citizen. None of the officers spoke among themselves or did they speak to Mr. Floyd.  They did not respond to his pleas for life. They just sat and kneeled on him until he was passed out and then waited an additional 4 minutes after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness to ensure that Mr. Floyd was dead and could not be revived.  The bystanders are verbally communicating to the officers, that he isn't breathing. Unlike any other similar incident, you never see the officers getting on police radios. You never see or hear them calling dispatch for backup. No other police units arrive on the scene and Ôøºstrangely enough, the crowd does not seem to grow either. The scene does not end until an ambulance arrives and they unceremoniously flop him on a gurney.  At no point does anyone in a uniform ever check his vitals. ‚ÄúAs if they aren't remotely curious about the situation they are in‚Äù BTW. who called the ambulance and for what reason? Because if the reason was that Mr. Floyd was having a medical issue, they wouldn't have still been crushing his neck.   Shortly after the video went viral, a fake Facebook page supposedly belonging to the officer,  at the center of the murder appears and pictures are uploaded that say ""Stand your Ground"" and ""Trump 2020"".   A picture of the cop with a red ballcap that says ""Make America White Again"".  A friends list populated with obvious sock accounts and people clearly not his friends.   This is the same kind of fake Facebook stunt that happened with a group made to look like support for the men involved with the Ahmed Aubrey case. Is it mere coincidence that this happens the week after ‚Äúrace‚Äù becomes a major political issue after the Biden ""You ain't Black"" gaffe, started to threaten the black vote the Democrats so desperately count on?  Additionally, there is substantial video evidence to arrest at least one officer now.  Why would the local authorities not charge him immediately, unless there was a political advantage not to!  Is it mere coincidence that this happens right about the exact moment the COVID-19 fear campaign falls apart, and after it has psychologically traumatized the entire country and got everyone at each other's throats and suicide attempts are spiking?   Is it mere coincidence that this happens after the Auhmed Aubrey case... Which somehow eluded the mainstream media completely until two whole months after he was killed? When has that ever happened? Timing issue?  Is it mere coincidence that Supreme Race Baiter Obama was making videos a couple weeks ago connecting COVID with ""Systemic Racism""? FINALLY....‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è this entire scene plays out with the cop car and license plate that says ""POLICE"".  The plate was perfectly framed for maximum subliminal impact. This also means he was literally just 1 foot away from the back seat of the police car and these cops thought it was smarter to kill a black man on camera, than to pick him up and move him one foot into the back of the police car. You can draw your own conclusions, but this appears to have all the earmarks of George Soros.  Please open your eyes!!!!

Doctors for my 3 month old son and was told 3 Asians had been in previously that
had been exposed to Coronavirus (unaware If they have it) and I was asked to wait
outside, I cancelled our appointment and left. Assuming they are local so perhaps
keeping small children away from public places for a while may be best.

*TRUMP HAS SPOKEN AGAIN. JUST THE TRUTH*

""DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH ON ""RISE UP AFRICANS"".

*They are good in nothing else but making noise, dancing, marrying many wives, alcoholism, witchcraft, indulging in sex, pretending in church, jealousy, fighting and complaining of bad leadership; but, yet refuse to take a decisive action and protest to remove the brigands from position of power.*

*Let us all accept the fact that the black man is a symbol of poverty, mental inferiority, laziness and emotional incompetence.To make the matter worse, he can do everything possible to defend his stupidity. Give them money for development and they will fight and create hatred and enmity for themselves. Drill oil wells for them and they will not have peace all the days of their life.*
*See, for instance, what's happening in Nigeria (a Country blessed with abundant resources), Southern Sudan, Malawi, DRC just to mention at few.*
*""This proves to anybody including a stupid fool that Africans do not know what they want. isn't that plausible""?* 
*""They are like monkeys looking for already ripping banana all over the world!!!.*

*Therefore that the white man is created to rule the black man, Africans will always have day dreams.*
*And here is the creature (black man) that lacks foresight but only sees what is near him and still fails to know what to do""*
*A black man is stupid to the extent that he cannot plan for his life beyond a year. Therefore how can they develop and live longer.*

*""Corruption in the west (And China) is a big abomination,  but  in Africa, it's so huge that it is slowly becoming an acceptable way of life!!!.*(Shame, isn't it?)

*They sing and rejoice to their corrupt political leaders.They worship their scandal-ridden religious leaders like their gods. Lest you forget, these so called Africans are praising, dancing and praying for the people that have impoverished them,and who comes to hide their loot here.*

*Then which fool argues that the black man is not born a beggar, grows a beggar, looks a beggar, falls sick as a beggar and dies a beggar. this has been proven beyond reasoning.*
*I wonder why even up to now most Africans still go to school by force, and those who are at school are are just drug addicts who don't know what took them there. This is a pregnant stupidity in Africa.  The body of Africans is a very fertile ground for all diseases in the world because they don't fear even HIV/AIDS.*
*This leaves me with a question:  Are our eyes created the same with those Africans? I hear there are still cultures in Africa that prohibit them from using latrines which is very annoying.*

*""They cried for independence but have failed to rule themselves"". For sure being African is a very untreatable disease that even prayers are not enough.*
*They have minerals but they cannot do anything with it. Therefore let us (whites) go to Africa and pick what we can pick and leave what is of no use. Poverty is a disease to the whites, but to the blacks it is very normal.*

*""Look at what is currently going on in Nigeria National Assembly.  Legislators amending the constitution to favor themselves at the expense of two (200) million Nigerians.

*""Majority of these legislators are treasury looters who are intellectually barren but using the ill gotten wealth to oppress the citizens of that great country"".* 

*""What a shame""!*
 *Black people with black sense. The worst tragedy in Africa is that if you dare stand up and speak up for what's right, you may end up regretting.*
*""The few wise and open-minded Africans who have tried to educate these fools about civilization have met the worst.They have been pushed hard on the wall, they have been silenced and others have been killed"".*
*Before I finish, let me tell Africans that before you jump and call me a racist, an anti-blacks or whatever term you may wish to use against me,1st tackle  runaway corruption, dreadful terrorism, tribalism, poverty, unemployment,  diseases, illiteracy, ignorance, and  inequality, that have put your whole continent on the verge of collapse"".*
*""Hate me or love me, I don't care.I know this is the plain truth which will never see the light of the day to the cowards that are afraid to be told as it is"".*

He argues that the black man can defend his stupidity by giving money for development, which leads to conflict and hatred. He also mentions that drilling oil wells for them makes them unhappy.

Then the text goes on to describe various African countries like Nigeria, Southern Sudan, Malawi, and DRC. It points out that these countries have abundant resources, which makes the black man's efforts to improve their lives more difficult. The black man is seen as a symbol of poverty and is criticized for not taking decisive action. He argues that the white man is created to rule the black man, implying that they will always have day dreams.

The text then goes into more detail about the black man's characteristics: he's married to many wives, alcoholistic, involved in witchcraft, pretending in church, and having jealousy and fighting. He's criticized for not taking decisive action and protesting to remove the black leaders from power.

The text also talks about corruption in the west and Africa, comparing it to the West's corruption. It mentions that in Africa, corruption is so big that it's becoming an acceptable way of life. The black man is praised for praising the corrupt political leaders, which leads to protests and hatred.

The text then mentions that the black man is a symbol of poverty, mental inferiority, laziness, and emotional incompetence, implying that he is a symbol of African poverty. It also says that the white man is created to rule the black man, implying that they will always have day dreams.

The text goes on to talk about African diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and how the black population is a fertile ground for diseases they don't fear. It mentions that the black man doesn't fear HIV/AIDS, which is a problem for them.

The text also mentions that the black man is a very naive and unwise, as they don't know what to do. They argue that they cannot plan for their life beyond a year, which makes them feel defeated. They also criticize school for being forced on the black population, which they find stupid and ineffective.

The text then goes on to talk about corruption again, this time in China, which is seen as a big problem, but in Africa, it's so huge that it's becoming an acceptable way of life. The text also mentions that corruption in the West is a big issue, but in Africa, it's so bad that it's becoming an acceptable way of life. It then compares the black man to the West's corrupt leaders, praising them for their corruption and criticizing the white leaders for not taking action.

This was shown on the program Landline on the ABC  
Think about this and circulate to your family and friends:

The ONLY Australian manufacturer of frozen Australian grown vegetables (Simplot Australia) whose brands are Birdseye and Edgells is not far from closing because a number of the other well-known Australian brands have moved their plants to New Zealand in order to capture the Chinese vegetable market where they market via New Zealand to Australian tables (without the food being labelled specifically as Chinese) and Simplot is finding it hard to compete.  

SHOULD SIMPLOT CLOSE, THIS MEANS THAT NO AUSTRALIAN GROWN FROZEN VEGETABLES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ALL AND WE WILL BE RELYING ON FOOD GROWN TOTALLY OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA.
 
For a number of reasons this is not a good situation.

1. As most people know, other countries do not necessarily have the strict guidelines for growing their vegetables that Australia has and by buying Australian we can be sure that lethal chemicals that may be used in other countries will not be used on Australian vegetables.

2. We would be losing Australians jobs.

3. If ever the world became unstable regarding wartime we would not be able to feed ourselves

It is imperative that we all support these Australian brands selling good Australian vegetable products (via Simplot):  Birdseye and Edgell.
   
Next time you shop, please think about the future of Australian food. 

What do you reckon folks? Let‚Äôs buy Birdseye and Edgell. 

Some of us love our designer labels.  We buy premium brand shoes, premium brand clothing and well known premium perfumes and handbags. 
BUT ... we also look for and buy the cheapest food we can for our children to eat.  That doesn't make sense. 

This is so true.  The farmers in Tasmania are extremely worried about Simplot's impending closure. They also have a lone food processing plant in Bathurst subjected to the same uncertainty.

If these last remaining plants close, it means that China then has total control over our fresh/frozen vegie industry. 

It is particularly disturbing to see that Chinese-grown vegetables are coming in branded as a product of New Zealand.

PLEASE PASS THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN
DON'T BITCH LATER ON WHEN ALL FOOD IS IMPORTED AND EXPENSIVE JUST BECAUSE WE SAVED A FEW CENTS BUYING THE CHEAPER BRAND TODAY AND HELPED TO CLOSE DOWN AUSTRALIA COMPANIES... This was shown on the program Landline on the ABC

This is so true.  The farmers in Tasmania are extremely worried about Simplot's impending closure. They also have a lone food processing plant in Bathurst subjected to the same uncertainty.

If these last remaining plants close, it means that China then has total control over our fresh/frozen vegie industry. 

It is particularly disturbing to see that Chinese-grown vegetables are coming in branded as a product of New Zealand.

PLEASE PASS THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN
DON'T BITCH LATER ON WHEN ALL FOOD IS IMPORTED AND EXPENSIVE JUST BECAUSE WE SAVED A FEW CENTS BUYING THE CHEAPER BRAND TODAY AND HELPED TO CLOSE DOWN AUSTRALIA COMPANIES...

Information from the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) doctor team:
Within this year you have to keep your distance, do not meet or eat together with people who have contracted covid-19. Must have an understanding of self-protection, do not be careless.

(I) Body surgery shows:
1. Covid-19 as a combination of SARS + AIDS. Many doctors assume, patients who have been discharged from the hospital, the nucleic acid test returned positive, this is not a recurrence, but has not fully recovered. This has to do with the characteristics of Covid-19.
2. The immune system is almost completely damaged. SARS only attacks the lungs, does not attack the body's immunity. AIDS attacks the body's immunity. While the damage to the organs of Covid-19 patients is like SARS + AIDS.
3. Acute lung organ damage is the leading cause of death for SARS sufferers. While death due to Covid-19 caused by ""failure of many organs"".

(II) The chairman of the major illness department of the Zhong Nan Hospital of Wuhan University, Prof. Peng Zhi Yong, after performing a body surgery, led the team to discuss the following:
1. Patients who have been discharged from the hospital, the results of blood tests show that the lymphocyte index does not return to normal levels, the patient's immune system does not fully recover.
2. The nucleic acid examination of patients who have recently been discharged from the hospital, is negative, but the immune system is very bad, does not return intact. After leaving the hospital, it will easily return to be positive.
3. This condition is similar to hepatitis B patients, who in the long run will store the virus in their body.
4. Now there is a need to investigate the patient's body that stores the Covid-19 virus whether it can transmit it to other people.

(III) Doctors who are in the vanguard of healing, state:
1. Previously there was concentration in first aid for Covid-19 patients. As more and more patients ""get well"" and leave the hospital, it is necessary to shift focus to the problem of regulating patients who are discharged from the hospital. Prof. Peng Zhi Yong said:"" We will explore them next year, the changes that occur in patients who have been discharged from the hospital, the virus that is still stored in his body can be contagious, whether it affects the people around him.""
2. In this case, the war against Covid-19 is far from final.
‚òÖ So it is recommended: for at least the next year, go out to the house to wear a mask, try to avoid gathering or staying in public . Information from the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) doctor team:

Prolonged use of the mask produces hypoxia.
Breathing over and over exhaled air turns into carbon
dioxide, which is why we feel dizzy.
This intoxicates the user and much more when he must
move, carry out displacement actions.
It causes discomfort, loss of reflexes and conscious
thought.
It generates great fatigue.
In addition, oxygen deficiency causes glucose breakdown
and endangered lactic acid rise.
Some people drive their car with the mask on, that is very
dangerous, because, the stale air can make the driver lose
consciousness.
It is recommended to use it only if you have someone in
front or very close, and it is important to remember to lift it
every 10 minutes to continue feeling healthy.
It is counterproductive for people who serve the public for
8 hours, as they are intoxicating themselves without
knowing it.
Q
All lives are important.! ""
That prevention does not lead you to another problem ...
let's use the mask knowingly.

Antibody tests check your blood by looking for antibodies, which might tell you if you had a past infection with the virus that
causes COVID-19. Antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections and can provide protection against getting that
disease again (immunity). Antibodies are disease specific. For example, measles antibodies will protect you from getting
measles if you are exposed to it again, but they won't protect you from getting mumps if you are exposed to mumps.
Except in instances in which viral testing is delayed, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19
infection. An antibody test might not show if you have a current COVID-19 infection because it can take 1-3 weeks after
infection for your body to make antibodies. To see if you are currently infected, you need a viral test. Viral tests identify the
virus in samples from your respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose.",The essential primary claim is that antibody tests are not reliable for diagnosing COVID-19 infections and that viral testing is more effective.,Positive test for COVID-19 same as having had a common cold.

about how I'm going to pay the rent every week.""
Mick Danks has served almost all of his three year prison

Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia's
Provincial Health Officer made a rare Saturday appearance in the media to issue a warning to people who plan on using old pieces of gypsum boards to make their own glory holes, saying that there is a risk of exposure to asbestos and recommends airing on the side of caution and using newer sheets of drywall only.

""We realize that many British Columbians have been waiting for a long time for the opportunity to get intimate and a few of those who will choose to use glory holes need to be aware that older gypsum sheet that may be sitting in the basement or backyard will often contain toxic levels of asbestos."" Henry told reporters.

""The safest method yet to ensure zero risk of exposure to Covid 19 is getting off alone, using your own imagination, toys and electronic devices."" The health officer added.

""I know this is a topic that makes some people uncomfortable but I need to add that I've come across a few hospital reports of young men getting injured getting their genitals stuck in a small hole they made in a wall with a kitchen knife."" Dr, Henry said with a softer tone.

""Just to be clear, glory holes are small openings in a wall where a person will offer their intimate parts to a partner who is on the opposite side who will be pleasuring the exposed parts, ideally, until full satisfaction. This is all done in the spirit of doing your share to flatten the curve while having a bit of fun this summer.""

Prior to 1983, social security was
not taxable. Joe Biden voted
successfully in favor of taxing
50% of social security. In 1993,

Robbery Gang Caught With 7, 486, 300 After Invading Two Banks In Osogbo

ExclusiveFeb 17, 2021

The Commissioner of Police in a press conference in Osogbo reported a robbery gang that was caught with a large sum of money and guns. There names are Aderibigbe Oluwaseun, Ndubisi David, Ayuba Abubakar Saliu, and Nuhu Jimoh.

 
This gang robbed two banks and were about going away with about 7, 486, 300 before they were caught by the Police. It was a tough one as these robbers exchanged series of gunshots with the police officers but the officers were able to overpower them.

Aside from the money, they were also able to recover the three AK47 and one hundred and twenty four (124) rounds of live ammunition as well as a Nissan car the robbers use for their operations.

The police public relation officer, ASP Folashade Odoro disclosed that the robbers are really notorious robbers. They came for the operation fully armed. The officer explained that they planted explosives at different strategic location. However the police were swift in their response and exhibited professionalism in overcoming these robbers. She added that the police anti- squad team were able to detect those explosives and deactivated them in the shortest possible time.

Further investigation revealed that the robbers were from Kogi and Benue State but travelled down to Osun to execute their criminal act after speaking extensively with their informants.

The two banks that were attacked are along Ekeinde road in Ikirun, Ifelodun Local Government area. It was a gloomy Friday as some Bank officials lost their life during exchange of bullets between the police and the robbers.
The response of the police is indeed commendable.

ANYONE WHO UNDERSTANDS A BIT ABOUT VIRUS AND THROMBOSIS SHOULD READ THIS ARTICLE. If the article is medically valid, then we might have found the root of the problem, which is: COVID 19 is NOT A VIRUS and the diagnostic and treatment protocols that we have been using are not appropriate! Italy, according to this article (not sure if it is true) has corrected its protocol and based on my initial fact checking, the RECOVERY RATE OF ITALY IS NOW 61 per cent, very high compared to Philippines' recovery rate of only 10 per cent. Let us have an open but extremely cautious mind to help each other find out whether COVID is not virus at all.  
_________________________________________________

Thanks to the autopsies performed by the Italians... it was shown that * is not pneumonia... but is: * scattered intravascular clotting * (thrombosis). So the way to fight it is with * antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulants.*

Protocols are changing üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº According to valuable information from Italian pathologists, the fans, nor the intensive care unit were never needed.

If this is true for all cases, we are about to solve sooner than anticipated. Important and novel About Coranovirus:
Worldwide, COVID-19 has been badly attacked for a serious diagnostic error. He shot a video of a Mexican family in the United States that claimed they were healed with a home remedy: Three aspirin 500 gr dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey, is taken hot and the next day, as if nothing had them Past! Well, the scientific information that follows gives you the reason!

This information was disseminated by a research doctor from Italy:

Well thanks to 50 autopsies made to patients deceased by COVID-19, they found that it is NOT NEUMONY, in the strict sense, because the virus does not kill pneumocytes only of its kind but uses an inflammatory storm to create a thrombosis endothelial vascular, with the corresponding diffuse thrombosis the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed, but also, produces a heart attack, or stroke and many other thrombotic diseases, in fact the protocols have left useless antiviral therapies and have been concentrate on inflammatory and antiquagulants. These therapies should be done immediately, even at home, in which treatment responds very well to patients the later they are done, are less effective. In resuscitation, they are almost useless. If the Chinese had reported it, it would have been invested in home therapy, not intensive care! A DISEMINTRAVASCUAL COAGUALTION (TROMBOSIS). So the way to fight it is with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and anticougulates.

An Italian anatomical pathologist reports that Pergamo hospital did a total of 50 autopsies and Milan 20 sack, so Italian casuistic is the tallest in the world the Chinese have only made 3, it which seems to fully confirm the above information, in a few words success is determined by a scattered intravascular clotting activated by the virus, then interstitial pneumonia would have nothing to do with this, it would have been just a huge diagnostic error. We doubled the number of Ranimation sites in ICU, with exorbitant costs, unnecessarily. In retrospecitva I have to rethink about these toraz X-rays that was commented a month ago that was commented as interstitial pneumonia, it could actually be totally consistent with a DICA scattered interstitial clotting.
People go to ICU for widespread venous embulism, usually pulmorary, if this were the case, intubations and resuscitation are useless, if thromboembulism is not solved first. If you vent a lung where blood doesn't come, it's useless, in fact, nine (9) out of ten (10) die. Because the problem is cardiovascular, not respiratory.

It's the venous microthrombosis, not nuemonia, that determine mortality. Why are the thrombos formed? Because inflammation according to school text induces thrombosis through a complex but well known physopathological mechanism. So what scientific literature said especially China until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory should not be used. Now the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatory and antibiotics as in influenzas, and the number of hospitalized patients has decreased. Many deaths even 40 years old had a history of fever from 10 to 15 days, which were not properly treated here inflammation destroyed everything and create the ground for the formation of thrombos, because the main problem is not the virus but the immune reaction that destroys the cell where the virus enters. In fact covid departments never entered patients with rheumatoid arthritis, because they are with cortisone therapy which is a great deimflammatory. That's the main reason why hospitalizations in Italy are declining and it's becoming a treatable disease at home. By treating her well at home, not only avoids hospitalization but also the risk of thrombosis. It wasn't easy to understand, because the signs of microembulism has faded even into the ecocardio.
This weekend the data was made for 50 patients between those who breathe badly and those who don't and the situation seems very clear.

With this important find, you could return to normal life and open business closed for quarantine, not immediately, but it is time to publish this data, so that the health authorities of each country, do their respective analysis of this information and avoid more useless deaths and vaccine can come later.
In Italy from today the protocols are changing.
According to valuable information from Italian pathologists, fans or ICU are not needed. So we need to rethink investments to adequately address this disease.

Well thanks to 50 autopsies made to patients deceased by COVID-19, they found that it is NOT NEUMONY, in the strict sense, because the virus does not kill pneumocytes only of its kind but uses an inflammatory storm to create a thrombosis endothelial vascular, with the corresponding diffuse thrombosis the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed, but also, produces a heart attack, or stroke and many other thrombotic diseases, in fact the protocols have left useless antiviral therapies and have been concentrate on inflammatory and antiquagulants. These therapies should be done immediately, even at home, in which treatment responds very well to patients the later they are done, are less effective. In resuscitation, they are almost useless. If the Chinese had reported it, it would have been invested in home therapy, not intensive care! A DISEMINTRAVASCUAL COAGUALTION (TROMBOSIS). So the way to fight it is with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and anticougulates.

An Italian anatomical pathologist reports that Pergamo hospital did a total of 50 autopsies and Milan 20 sack, so Italian casuistic is the tallest in the world the Chinese have only made 3, it which seems to fully confirm the above information, in a few words success is determined by a scattered intravascular clotting activated by the virus, then interstitial pneumonia would have nothing to do with this, it would have been just a huge diagnostic error. We doubled the number of Ranimation sites in ICU, with exorbitant costs, unnecessarily. In retrospecitva I have to rethink about these toraz X-rays that was commented a month ago that was commented as interstitial pneumonia, it could actually be totally consistent with a DICA scattered interstitial clotting.
People go to ICU for widespread venous embulism, usually pulmorary, if this were the case, intubations and resuscitation are useless, if thromboembulism is not solved first. If you vent a lung where blood doesn't come, it's useless, in fact, nine (9) out of ten (10) die. Because the problem is cardiovascular, not respiratory.

It's the venous microthrombosis, not nuemonia, that determine mortality. Why are the thrombos formed? Because inflammation according to school text induces thrombosis through a complex but well known physopathological mechanism. So what scientific literature said especially China until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory should not be used. Now the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatory and antibiotics as in influenzas, and the number of hospitalized patients has decreased. Many deaths even 40 years old had a history of fever from 10 to 15 days, which were not properly treated here inflammation destroyed everything and create the ground for the formation of thrombos, because the main problem is not the virus but the immune reaction that destroys the cell where the virus enters. In fact covid departments never entered patients with rheumatoid arthritis, because they are with cortisone therapy which is a great deimflammatory. That's the main reason why hospitalizations in Italy are declining and it's becoming a treatable disease at home. By treating her well at home, not only avoids hospitalization but also the risk of thrombosis. It wasn't easy to understand, because the signs of microembulism has faded even into the ecocardio.
This weekend the data was made for 50 patients between those who breathe badly and those who don't and the situation seems very clear.

With this important find, you could return to normal life and open business closed for quarantine, not immediately, but it is time to publish this data, so that the health authorities of each country, do their respective analysis of this information and avoid more useless deaths and vaccine can come later.
In Italy from today the protocols are changing.
According to valuable information from Italian pathologists, fans or ICU are not needed. So we need to rethink investments to adequately address this disease. None","The essential primary claim is that COVID-19 is not a virus but a disorder characterized by a severe diagnostic error, leading to ineffective and high mortality rates. The Italian protocols, which were flawed, were changed to improve treatment, resulting in better recovery rates and a reduction in hospitalizations.","Aspirin, lemon juice and honey mixture as home remedy for COVID-19"

Who is Modi?
  commented  by New York Times Editor-in-Chief Joseph Hope
 
  ""The rise of this man is a threat to the world, as he has not only made enemies of each other's interests in India but also used them.  It only shows the desire to make India a great country.  His sole aim is to make India supreme.  If this person is not blocked, then one day in the future India will become a powerful nation around the world and it will surprise the United States.
  He goes through a specific strategy and no one knows what he wants to do.  A dangerous patriot is hidden behind his smiling face.  He uses all the countries of the world for the benefit of India.
  By destroying the US relationship with Pakistan and Afghanistan, and forming alliances with enemies like Vietnam, Modi will see the use of the three countries against China.
  Vietnam began producing oil in China's southern seaboard, where it supplies all its oil to India, and the Indian company forced Reliance to work, where American dominance would cease.
  Now, China's enemy is US control over Vietnam, which is good for India.   Launch India has invested $ 1.5 million from both countries against China and the US, which India cannot achieve in eight years.
  Today, this person is turning Pakistan into a poor state. The old Pakistan ally of Iran's port, close to the Afghan border and the establishment of an Indian military station on the Afghan border.  It has also shown Iran the path of leaving Pakistan to Afghanistan, allowing Indian trade.
  Sections 2 and 3A were cancelled by Pakistan.  Now a days, Pak Occupied Kashmir  will be taken over.Pakistan will fall into four pieces.  It will dance on Modi's warning.
  Pakistan's traditional ally, Saudi Arabia, will also play a crucial role in separating Pakistan.
  This man who ended China and America in Asia, cancelled the SAARC conference and showed his power to the world.
  Modi succeeded in establishing India's superiority over Asia ...
  It achieved alliance with the two great powers of Asia, Russia and Japan.  , China can do some of the most obvious threats to invasion, Hong Kong Today, another Hong Kong China will try.  Modi is ready to take over the POC to stop the CPEC, so China is willing to give up 40% stake in India by announcing Modi, but Modi is not in the mood to listen and therefore keeps the state of Pakistan without a war beggar.  As a result, China's $ 62 billion is stored in water.
  Modi affirmed India in the MTCR group by lobbying the US government.  Modi will replace NSG in a short period of time.  It's hard for the US to move on.  Moreover, this person took Indian politics to another level.
  The world must think that every country has many enemies, but India has no enemy except Pakistan.  It is almost certain that its solution is India.
  This person can use a left tackle as a surgical strike.  This man is doing more harm to Pakistan than the actual war.
  By using Muslim countries against Pakistan, Modi proved himself to be one of the world's greatest leaders.
  In all of these negotiations, the integrity of this person should be noted.  India's progress will be difficult for the rest of the world.
  That is why I am in favour of discussing and thinking with all the thinkers in the world.  If possible, a backward country like India should try not to be world superintendent.  Otherwise, the United Nations and all mankind will suffer the consequences"" Who is Modi?

I ran across this.....for those of us that remember Mr. Kissinger, he was the consummate negotiator in his day.....his opinion is DEFINITELY more informed than the Hollywood elite, more honest than the socialists masquerading as democrats, and imho, he hits the nail on the head! Kissinger take on Trump Kissinger is now 96 years old.  Recently, Henry Kissinger did an interview and said very amazing things regarding President Trump. He starts with: ""Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven't seen before!"" The former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trump's foreign policy and predicts its success: ""Liberals and all those who favor (Hillary) Clinton will never admit it. ""They will never admit that he is the one true leader.  The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation's people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference."" Kissinger knows it and he continues with: ""Every country now has to consider two things: One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities. ""And secondly, that there is a new president who's asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.  And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it."" Then Kissinger puts it bluntly: ""Trump puts America and its people first.  This is why people love him and this is why he will remain in charge for so long  There is not a single thing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes.""  When he boasts that he has a ""bigger red button"" than Kim Jung Un does, he so transcends the mealy-mouthed rhetoric of the past, thereby forcing a new recognition of American power. Kissinger once wrote: ""The weak grow strong by effrontery ‚Äì The strong grow weak through inhibition!""  No sentence better captures the U.S.-North Korea relationship. Trump is discarding the inhibitions and calling the bluff on North Korea's effrontery: His point is that the contrast of American retreat under Obama and its new assertion of power under Trump creates a new dynamic that every one of our allies and of our enemies must consider. Our allies grew complacent with Obama's passivity and now are fearful due to Trump's activism.  And they must balance the two in developing their policies: They realize that the old assumptions, catalyzed by Bush 43's preoccupation with Iraq and Obama's refusal to lead are obsolete.  So, Trump is forcing a new calculus with a new power behind American interests.  Those ‚Äî here and abroad ‚Äî who rode the old apple cart worry about it being toppled. But, as Kissinger so boldly stated: ""Trump is the one true leader in world affairs and he is forcing policy changes that put America first!‚Äú This is the most accurate statement of what the American Citizens who live outside of the swamp want and expect from their government.  I like the list of 13 things that I, as a senior American citizen, want.  Trump is at least talking about issues that most Americans are concerned about.

I ran across this.....for those of us that remember Mr. Kissinger, he was the consummate negotiator in his day.....his opinion is DEFINITELY more informed than the Hollywood elite, more honest than the socialists masquerading as democrats, and imho, he hits the nail on the head! Kissinger take on Trump Kissinger is now 96 years old.  Recently, Henry Kissinger did an interview and said very amazing things regarding President Trump. He starts with: ""Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven't seen before!"" The former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trump's foreign policy and predicts its success: ""Liberals and all those who favor (Hillary) Clinton will never admit it. ""They will never admit that he is the one true leader.  The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation's people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference."" Kissinger knows it and he continues with: ""Every country now has to consider two things: One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities. ""And secondly, that there is a new president who's asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.  And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it."" Then Kissinger puts it bluntly: ""Trump puts America and its people first.  This is why people love him and this is why he will remain in charge for so long  There is not a single thing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes.""  When he boasts that he has a ""bigger red button"" than Kim Jung Un does, he so transcends the mealy-mouthed rhetoric of the past, thereby forcing a new recognition of American power. Kissinger once wrote: ""The weak grow strong by effrontery ‚Äì The strong grow weak through inhibition!""  No sentence better captures the U.S.-North Korea relationship. Trump is discarding the inhibitions and calling the bluff on North Korea's effrontery: His point is that the contrast of American retreat under Obama and its new assertion of power under Trump creates a new dynamic that every one of our allies and of our enemies must consider. Our allies grew complacent with Obama's passivity and now are fearful due to Trump's activism.  And they must balance the two in developing their policies: They realize that the old assumptions, catalyzed by Bush 43's preoccupation with Iraq and Obama's refusal to lead are obsolete.  So, Trump is forcing a new calculus with a new power behind American interests.  Those ‚Äî here and abroad ‚Äî who rode the old apple cart worry about it being toppled. But, as Kissinger so boldly stated: ""Trump is the one true leader in world affairs and he is forcing policy changes that put America first!‚Äú This is the most accurate statement of what the American Citizens who live outside of the swamp want and expect from their government.  I like the list of 13 things that I, as a senior American citizen, want.  Trump is at least talking about issues that most Americans are concerned about. My mantra about Trump is this: Truthfully, we are in agreement with most of what he says.  We are getting older and our tickers aren't what they used to be, but what matters is that he covers most of the 13 things we as seniors want, at least I do for sure: 1.  Hillary:  held accountable for her previous wrongs! 2.  Put ""GOD"" back in America! 3.  Borders:  Closed or tightly guarded! 4.  Congress:  On the same retirement and healthcare plans as everybody else. 5.  Congress:  Obey its own laws NOW! 6.  Language:  English! 7.  Culture:  Constitution and the Bill of Rights! 8.  Drug-Free:  Mandatory Drug Screening before and during Welfare! 9.  Freebies:  NONE to Non-Citizens! 10.  Budget:  Balance the damn thing! 11.  Foreign Countries:  Stop giving them our money!  Charge them for our help!  We need it here. 12.  Term limits for congress And most of all. 13. ‚ÄúRESPECT OUR MILITARY AND OUR FLAG AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT!"" We the people are coming!

PARIS: In a major development that should silence critics of Islam who have been blaming it for terrorism, UNESCO has declared that Islam is the most peaceful religion of the world.

The United Nations body released a statement earlier today that revealed that UNESCO had partnered with International Peace Foundation six months back to study all religions of the world and find out which was most peaceful amongst all.

‚ÄúAfter six months of rigorous study and analysis, we have concluded that Islam is the most peaceful religion,‚Äù Robert McGee, head of comparative studies wing of International Peace Foundation declared in a press conference that was attended by UNESCO officials too.

When asked about the terror attacks being carried out in the name of Islam, including the recent ones in Dhaka and Baghdad, the UNESCO official denied that it had anything to do with Islam.

‚ÄúTerror has no religion,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIslam means peace.‚Äù

To document this official recognition, UNESCO will issue certificates to interested Muslim bodies, which can choose to display them at various places like madarsas, Islamic study centers, mosques, halal stores, slaughterhouses, etc.

Junta Ka Reporter was also given a copy of certificate so that we can display the same to our readers. A copy has also been put in the office of our founder Mr. Mofat Javed.

‚ÄúRight Wing organizations should stop maligning Islam and Muslims at least after this certificate from UNESCO,‚Äù our founder editor Mofat Javed hoped.

The certificate and announcement from UNESCO has been welcomed by world leaders and religious leaders across the world. Dalai Lama is reported to have asked other religions to learn from Islam and try to be as nonviolent and compassionate as the religion of peace.

However, some Muslim scholars have said that the act of UNESCO was not needed as Islam was already the best and final religion, and a certificate to the same amounts to trivializing the issue as it states the obvious.

The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from the Consulate at Bergen, Norway.

Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard of temperatures in the Arctic zone.

Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes.

Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm

Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.

Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before
ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.

Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coast cities uninhabitable.

I must apologize. I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2, 1922, as reported by the AP and published in The Washington Post 98 years ago. This must have been caused by the Model T Ford's emissions or possibly from horse, pigs and cattle flatulence.

I ask everyone to share this so that the world
can see what is going on in South Africa.
On Sunday, 3 May 2020, at 4:20pm, the South African police
(SAPS) prevented a church from delivering 200 food parcels to
the Bonaccord white squatter camp in Pretoria. SAPS said that
no food is allowed to be delivered to white people. They
confiscated all of the food parcels. The church that delivered
this food to the squatter camp was fined R10,000.
Like
The mainstream media in South Africa are not talking about
this and similar atrocities being committed across the country.
Surely this is a crime against humanity?

that CO2 is shown as 82%.
But no mention is made that
this chart includes only ""man-

not included as a greenhouse

vapor, this pie chart is very
deceptive and greatly
exaggerates CO2's role as a

WE HAVE REDUCED PDP'S DEBT BY HALF - ODSG

The Ondo State Government has disclosed that it has reduced the N220B debt inherited from the immediate past  People's Democratic Party (PDP) government by over fifty percent. 

The government said it has also shore up the Internally General Revenue (IGR) of the state from the N700Million inherited from the PDP administration to over N1Billion monthly.

The state commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo made this known while featuring on Channels Television current affairs programme, Sunrise Daily on Monday.

The Commissioner said Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu's administration signed a pact with the people of the state to ensure all-round development in the three senatorial district of the state.

According to the government spokesperson, the Akeredolu administration has been unrelenting in its efforts to use Industrialization to drive the fortunes of the state, particularly on improved IGR.

Asked whether the N30billion bond which the state sought  to borrow won't put the state in more debt as being  insuniated by the PDP, Ojogo explained that  since the government wasn't sourcing for loans from banks or any other means other than the capital market, the loans will surely be sorted in line with extant financial provisions.

He said:""Our resolve as a government is that by the time we leave office in the next five years, I said in the next five years because Mr. Governor is going to recontest and win by God's grace, we hope to leave the government without debt for the incoming administration after our two terms.

""The PDP will not deny the fact that we are constricting a flyover in Ore, we have leveled up a hill in Ikare and made it dual carriage way, we are changing the face of Akure with massive infrastructure.""

On the minimum wage, the Information Commissioner said the state government's approach to the payment  was unique, adding that unlike some states, the government has agreed to pay the N30, 000 new minumum wage and leave bonus separately.

He assured that the Akeredolu administration will remain  workers' friendly. WE HAVE REDUCED PDP'S DEBT BY HALF - ODSG

coming out a warning that vaccinated people may not be allowed to travel because of the danger of
blood clots in the mile-high atmosphere. In Spain, the same thing is appearing. This has raised
concerns that are the objective of this vaccine to prevent travel?

hours on airplanes.

ICC-CPI-202211306-KE
Press Release: 18.01.2022
Situation in Kenya: Alarming political statements and incitement to violence
It is with deep regret that we have received reports on the use of the phrase ""madoadoa"", a derogatory
term previously used to describe members of a certain community as aliens (Transcript of hearing on 24
February 2014, ICC-01/09-01/11-T-93-Red-ENG WT). That these utterances were made in Eldoret, the
epicenter of the 2007/8 Post-Election Violence (PEV) in Kenya is particularly tragic.
This form of othering is what led to one of the most unfortunate chapters of Kenya's history. Over 1,000
people were killed, over 900 acts of rape and sexual violence were documented and well over 300,000
people were displaced. OTP captured cases of brutality; burning of victims alive and attacks in places of
worship where IDPs had sought refuge. It is this othering that led to the installation of checkpoints
where perpetrators of violence would select their victims based on ethnicity and hack them to death,
commit gang rape and engage in genital mutilation.
The Court would like to remind Kenyan leaders of how far reaching the devastation was. Children were
unable to go to school and there was loss of income due to loss of jobs and inability to re-establish
businesses. The contraction of sexually transmitted diseases after rape, abandonment and separation of
families led to untold suffering.
The court watched in consternation as elected leaders and those seeking elective positions jostled to
defend this repugnant utterance. However, it was noted that a majority of the Kenyan citizens called out
the perpetrators and various institutions expeditiously took action.
This communication has been necessitated by what the court considers a dangerous trend that can
plunge the country back into a volatile situation during the electioneering period. Words that plant the
ideas of othering must be purged from Kenya's vocabulary. The court observes that the only viable
solution to the problem of othering is one involving inclusion. Everybody must feel free to make their
democratic choice without fear of discrimination or violence.

#COVID-19  

‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ WRITTEN BY DR. LEGRAND‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
When you get sick of CORONAVIRUS you're going to have a fever. Lots of fever. The highest fever ever given you. It's not going to look like typical flu fevers.

You're going to breathe slowly, like they put a sponge in your nose.
When you try to fill your lungs by inhaling hard, you're going to feel like you're still lacking the air. And that will scare you.

You're going to cough a lot. So much, you'll get tired until you almost pass out. Every time you do, your chest, arms, back, fingers, toes will hurt.

You're gonna try to grab air by the nose and you're not gonna be able to.

So I'm going to put your oxygen on which your nose is going to burn and that's going to hurt even more.

And if you can't get over it, another doctor is coming and he's going to put a couple of half-inch tubes down your throat to pass the bronchi and reach your lungs. That's called artificial respirator or fan.
It's annoying, and on top of it, you can't talk or eat

You'll be alone in a closed room. You won't be able to have your mom or your dad, or your kids that you love so much, or your brothers; because you will make them sick of the same thing that is killing you.

You're going to feel so alone, you're going to start crying and you're going to be afraid to die. You'll start remembering the ones you love and you'll cry. It'll get worse and your lack of air will get complicated.

IT'S THERE WHEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY THE STAY IN YOUR HOUSE. #COVID-19

LPG CYLINDER EXPIRY !!!

""Have U ever heard about LPG gas cylinder's expiry date...?
Expired Cylinders are not safe for use and may cause accidents. In this regard please be cautious at the time of accepting any LPG cylinder from the Vendor.
Here is how we can check the expiry of LPG cylinders:
On one of three side stems of the cylinder, the expiry date is coded alpha numerically as follows A or B or C or D and some two digit number following this e.g. D06.

The alphabets stand for quarters -
1. A for March (First Qtr),
2. B for June (Second Qtr),
3.. C for Sept (Third Qtr), &
4. D for December (Fourth Qtr).

The digits stand for the year till it is valid. Hence A07 would mean March qtr of 2007.

Please Return Back the Cylinder that you get with a Expiry Date, they are prone to Leak and other Hazardous accidents...

The second example with C13 allows the cylinder to be in use until Sept 2013.

Kindly pass this to every one to create awareness‚Ä¶ LPG CYLINDER EXPIRY !!!

nw-connection.com
The Virology Journal-the official publication of Dr.
Fauci's National Institutes of Health-published what is
now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the
heading-get ready for this-""Chloroquine is a
potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and
spread."" (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the
researchers, ""We report...that chloroquine has strong
antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells.
These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are
treated with the drug either before or after exposure
to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and
therapeutic advantage.""
This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci has known for 15
years that chloroquine and its even milder derivative
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current
case of coronavirus (""therapeutic"") but prevent future
cases (""prophylactic""). So HCQ functions as both a
cure and a vaccine. In other words, it's a wonder drug
for coronavirus, Said Dr. Fauci's NIH in 2005,
""concentrations of 10 ¬µM completely abolished SARS-
CoV infection,"" Fauci's researchers add, ""chloroquine
can effectively reduce the establishment of infection
and spread of SARS-CoV.","The essential primary claim is that chloroquine and HCQ are both a cure and a vaccine for COVID-19, as they exhibit antiviral and prophylactic effects.",the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks

UN-MASK OUR KIDS
LET'S TALK MOM TO MOM
I want my child to be safe.
Does a mask make my child MORE safe or LESS safe?
FACT: The chance of a child dying from Cavid-19 rounds to ZERO.
FACT: The chance of an asymptomatic child transmitting Covid- 19 rounds
to ZERO.
FACT: Children and anyone healthy are extremely resilient and natural
exposure to viruses helps build an even stronger immunity.
But the RISKS of mask-wearing for children are high:
‚Ä¢Inhaling the slow build up of CO¬≤ can cause headache, dizziness,
impaired cognition
‚Ä¢ Suffocation for babies or toddlers who cannot communicate when they
need more oxygen
‚Ä¢Inhaling micro-mold caused by trapped water vapor from exhalation
which causes sore throat and respiratory infection
Ingestion of bacteria or parasites on the mask from kids' unwashed
hands touching it, which can lead to pinworms or digestive illness
Our community is seeing evidence of ALL of these issues in children.

Please do this as a preventive measures in respect of CORONAVIRUS

 Lockdown has been removed in China.

 They opened dead bodies during post mortem to find out cause of death and how to control it. They have found out the cause and therefore removed the lockdown.

I want to share that information with you all.

The major cause of death is respiratory failure. The thick mucus in the throat stops air flow in airways, nasal chamber etc. That is why people need ventilators.

How to control it-

First of all, the mucus before entering lungs stays in the throat for 3 days. If we can neutralize it there itself, it will save you.

To neutralizes the threat in throat, drink hot liquids regularly like tea, coffee, hot water, turmeric in hot water. Drink as much hot water as possible.

This will take the thick mucus into our stomach where ever gastric juices will destroy it.

Second, do gargles with salt, turmeric, or any oral antiseptic.

Third, strengthen your immune system so strong. Eat fruits with high Vitamin C like citrus fruits.

Whenever you step out, people think to use sanitisers, masks etc. however this virus attaches to your hair and clothes also.

Therefore whenever you come back, don‚Äôt touch any part of door or gate, go directly to washroom, soak clothes in soap water and take shower.

If you touch any metallic substance the virus stays active on it for 9 hours. Use alcohol based cleaner to disinfectant.

Most important, don‚Äôt eat or drink anything cold this period, ice cream, soft drinks etc.
Don't take any thing cold, is not good for your system in preventive measures against CORONAVIRUS

All these are very important, 
hence sharing with you all.

University Labs Suing CDC for Covid
Fraud: Virus does not exist and is
fictitious
30.12.2020 15:16 Covid-19 | Health
December 30, 2020 by Steve Beckow
Stanford, Cornell and five other California university labs
""found C19 imaginary, fictitious, not a virus and were suing
the CDC for Covid Fraud,"" Rob Oswald, PhD in virology and
immunology, Cornell University:
""So what we're dealing with is just another flu strain like
every year, C19 does not exist and is fictitious. I believe
China and the globalists orchestrated this COVID hoax (the
flu disguised as a novel virus) to bring in global tyranny and
a worldwide police totalitarian surveillance state, and this
plot included massive Election Fraud.
""I have a PhD in virology and immunology. I'm a clinical lab
scientist and have tested 1500 ""supposed"" positive C19
samples collected here in S. California. When my lab team
and I did the testing through Koch's postulates and
observation under a SEM (scanning electron microscope),
we found NO Covid in any of the 1500 samples. What we
found was that all of the 1500 samples were mostly
Influenza A and some were influenza B, but not a single
case of Covid, and we did not use the B.S. PCR test.
""We then sent the remainder of the samples to Stanford,
Cornell, and a few of the University of California labs and
they found the same results as we did, NO COVID. They
found influenza A and B. All of us then spoke to the CDC
and asked for viable samples of COVID, which CDC said
they could not provide as they did not have any samples.","The essential primary claim is that the virus described is not real but a fake, and the labs are suing CDC for fraud.",Cornell University professor Rob Oswald said university labs are suing CDC saying Covid-19 does not exist

Our Brother Hank Aaron - RIP - wanted to be an example and an inspiration to Black People by taking the COVID-19 vaccine.

Kissinger takes on Trump!
Kissinger is now 96 years old.  Recently, Henry Kissinger did an interview and said very amazing things regarding President Trump.  He starts with:
""Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven't seen before!""
 
The former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trump's foreign policy and predicts its success:
""Liberals and all those who favor (Hillary) Clinton will never admit it.
""They will never admit that he is the one true leader.  The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation's people.
 
After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference.""
 
Kissinger knows it and he continues with:
 
""Every country now has to consider two things:
 
One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities.
""And secondly, that there is a new president who's asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.  And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it.""
 
Then Kissinger puts it bluntly: ""Trump puts America and its people first.  This is why people love him and this is why he will remain in charge for so long.  There is not a single thing wrong with him, and people need to open their eyes.""  When he boasts that he has a ""bigger red button"" than Kim Jung Un does, he so transcends the mealy-mouthed rhetoric of the past, thereby forcing a new recognition of American power.
 
Kissinger once wrote:
""The weak grow strong by effrontery ‚Äì The strong grow weak through inhibition!""  No sentence better captures the U.S.-North Korea relationship.
 
Trump is discarding the inhibitions and calling the bluff on North Korea's effrontery:
His point is that the contrast of American retreat under Obama and its new assertion of power under Trump creates a new dynamic that every one of our allies and of our enemies must consider.
 
Our allies grew complacent with Obama's passivity and now are fearful due to Trump's activism.  And they must balance the two in developing their policies:
They realize that the old assumptions, catalyzed by Bush 43's preoccupation with Iraq and Obama's refusal to lead are obsolete.  So, Trump is forcing a new calculus with a new power behind American interests.  Those ‚Äî here and abroad ‚Äî who rode the old apple cart worry about it being toppled.
 
But, as Kissinger so boldly stated:
""Trump is the one true leader in world affairs, and he is forcing policy changes that put America first!‚Äú
This is the most accurate statement of what the American Citizens who live outside of the swamp want and expect from their government.
 
I like the list of 13 things that I, as a senior American citizen, want.  Trump is at least talking about issues that most Americans are concerned about.
My mantra about Trump is this:
Truthfully, we are in agreement with most of what he says.  We are getting older and our tickers aren't what they used to be, but what matters is that he covers most of the 13 things we as seniors want, at least I do for sure:
 
1.  Hillary: held accountable for her previous wrongs!
2.  Put ""GOD"" back in America!
3.  Borders: Closed or tightly guarded!
4.  Congress: On the same retirement and healthcare plans as everybody else.
5.  Congress: Obey its own laws NOW!
6.  Language: English!
7.  Culture: Constitution and the Bill of Rights!
8.  Drug-Free: Mandatory Drug Screening before and during Welfare!
9.  Freebies: NONE to Non-Citizens!
10. Budget: Balance the damn thing!
11. Foreign Countries: Stop giving them our money!  Charge them for our help!  We need it here.
12. Term limits for congress
And most of all.
13. ‚ÄúRESPECT OUR MILITARY AND OUR FLAG AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT!""
 
We the people are coming!
 
Only 86% will send this on.  Should be 100%

√¢‚Ç¨¬¢ Influenza is an Electrical Disease √¢‚Ç¨¬¢ This is the best detective story ever written. The flu is not contagious. This quarantine is all a horrible hoax, deliberately inflicted upon the world to usher in totalitarian world government. The flu is not contagious. No flu has ever been contagious. Arthur Firstenberg has changed the future and won himself a Nobel Prize with the publication of The Invisible Rainbow, which proves, among other things, that . . . The flu is an electrical disease. The trigger, Firstenberg writes, is connected to seasonal variations in solar radiation, as so many have suggested over the previous two centuries. Long ago reports have shown that flu epidemics tend to occur during years of maximum solar activity, and that cases can rise and fall with the number of sunspots. Famous thinkers who have connected flu with sunspots range from Noah Webster to Fred Hoyle. In 1836 Heinrich Schweich observed that it was a common belief that accumulation of electricity within the body caused influenza. His contention has never been disproven, Firstenberg reports. The period of 1645 to 1715 is known as the Maunder Minimum, where no sunspots nor auroras were seen. There were also no worldwide pandemics. It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t until 1727 that sunspots numbered more than 100 for the first time in more than a century. In 1728 influenza arrived in waves over the surface of the Earth and lasted by some accounts until 1738. Some 2 million died, Firstenberg wrote. The pandemic of 1889-94 swept over the entire planet. Firstenberg theorizes that this accompanied the first electrification of the planet with electric lights turnin on everywhere. A litany of quotes from the past two centuries all testify to connection between worldwide influenza outbreaks and the solar cycle. Firstenberg targets the beginnings of misdiagnosis of a disease once called neurasthenia, or electrical sensitivity, to Sigmund Freud, who classified it as an √¢‚Ç¨≈ìanxiety neurosis√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in 1894, ending research into the electrical causes of the flu down to this very day. Cont:.√∞≈∏‚Äò‚Ä°","The essential primary claim is that influenza is caused by the solar cycle and is the best way to understand it, based on Firstenberg's theories and historical data.","Influenza is an ‚Äòelectrical disease,‚Äô New technology caused past pandemics"

NZ‚Äôs Government Lied about the Safety of the Covid19 Vaccines by Admin AntMarch 25, 2022 A US regional clinical trial director has filed a $2 Billion USD lawsuit against Pfizer for faking its trial data and publishing fraudulent safety claims about its highly experimental Covid19 vaccine. Pfizer‚Äôs CEO has stated to shareholders that they will lose billions in revenue and share value from that US court case (and however many more after it globally) as he knows the truth. Prior to Covid19, Pfizer was rated the least trustworthy of corporations in the least trusted industry due to an historic amount of court fines ‚Äì over $4 Billion USD for attempting to hide the harm and deaths from other products it lied about the safety of but still sold, including a charge of bribing a grand jury. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî This government knew that, and it knew that it only received enough Pfizer Covid19 vaccine supply suddenly because India etc rejected it based on suspecting Pfizer lied about its trials and because it would not allow localised trials by governments to confirm its efficacy and safety claims. This government and PM also ignored MedSafe‚Äôs warnings that the Pfizer vaccine had 58 serious issues with it, but pushed it on NZers anyways and lied about its safety. MedSafe‚Äôs latest adverse reactions report and NZ doctors estimate over 160,000 NZers and increasing per day, have serious ‚Äì life threatening and shortening adverse reactions to this vaccine. ACC is overwhelmed by increasing adverse reactions injury claims from this vaccine and has already approved 1,996 claims. The UK government ceased all mandates because its own data proved the vaccine had negative efficacy and a UK Police case regarding that had got to the international criminal court in The Hague. NZ‚Äôs government and agencies have breached the NZ Bill of Rights and gone against the medical science according to the recent court case that ruled mandates illegal for the Police and Army, and they have breached the Nuremberg Code.

READ: Chad Booc? He is no hero volunteer for the indigenous people of Mindanao. Booc is in fact deployed purposely and deliberately as a full-time CPP cadre operative to do 'legal institution' work for the cpp-npa-ndf in the MISFI alternative Lumad or IP schools, in order to unify and implement the cpp-npa-ndf program of expansion, recovery and consolidation among various IP communities in Mindanao. Booc has consistently been an underground recruiter and operator for the cpp-npa-ndf even during his student days in UP Diliman, where he was part of the CPP Party Branch unit in College of Engineering. His operations included recruitment of young students, some are minors to become part of the CPP and NDF affiliated organization for the youth and students which supports the armed and terroristic activities of the cpp-npa-ndf - - the organization of KABATAANG MAKABAYAN or KM. BOOC continues with his nefarious and terroristic activities in Mindanao, by being part of the core cadre operatives of the cpp-npa-ndf who were deployed to provide directional leadership to cpp-created so called MISFI Institution, where the cpp-npa-ndf fund raising, resource generation, recruitment for the NPA, among other activities, have been concealed through their so called 'alternative Lumad schools project,' like ALCADEV, SALUGPUNGAN, etc.. Clearly, Chad Booc is the embodiment of the operational doctrine of the cpp-npa-ndf, known as 'revolutionary dual tactics', where they are able to circumvent and exploit our laws and legal system, to their advantage, just like the duplicitous and deceptive schemes of mafia-like operations of CPP Partylists, led by Zarate, Elago, et al. This dubious CPP-NPA-NDF operative Chad Booc must be exposed to the public, so that their evil deeds against the IPs in Mindanao, especially against the IP youth and children, must be put to a stop, and the bar of justice shall bear upon them. SAMBAYANAN February 17, 2021 #Sambayanan #NTFELCAC #EO70","Chad Booc is a member of the cpp-npa-ndf and has been involved in illegal activities, such as recruiting minors for the cpp-npa-ndf's programs.",The UP College of Engineering (UP CoE) is housing a branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).

Airpods and Bluetooth Earbuds Emit Wireless Radiation Airpods emit wireless radiofrequency (RFR) radiation, the same of wireless radiation that your cell phone emits ‚Äì and the same type of radiation that the World Health Organization listed as a Class 2B carcinogen in 2011. Now, over a decade later, many scientists have published research stating this radiation is a proven human carcinogen. Over one dozen governments and numerous medical organizations warn you to keep this type of radiation away from your head.
Airpod Facts
AirPods, like other Bluetooth headsets and earpods, will constantly transmit signals while they are in your ears, whether you are using them or not. Airpods sir right near your skull. They transmit RFR directly next to your brain and ear, and the RFR is absorbed into your brain and ear tissues. Apple‚Äôs second generation AirPods are Bluetooth Class 1 ‚Äì meaning they reach to hundreds of feet away and emit higher radiation compared to other Bluetooth devices. The left AirPod communicates with the right AirPod using a technology called ‚Äúnear field magnetic induction‚Äù (NFMI). The fields go right though your brain. Magnetic fields are linked to cancer and oxidative stress.","Airpods emit wireless radiation, which is a known cancer-related carcinogen.",A social media post claims that Apple AirPods are dangerous because they emit radiation which is harmful to the human body.

‚ú®begrudgingly Biden‚ú® I hope that you will join me in voting for Joe Biden for president. He‚Äôs an awful pick. He‚Äôs ancient, showing pretty severe signs of dementia, doesn‚Äôt believe in legalizing weed, wrote a bill that is a huge contributor to our mass incarceration problem, oh yeah, and he‚Äôs a creepy rapist. BUT: he‚Äôs not trump.

Our democracy has failed us so severely in giving us no option but to give in and vote for someone we may not even support, but it will only get worse if we allow another trump victory. And that victory is guaranteed if we abstain, vote third party, or write in a name. We have to play in the system we have until we have changed it - abolished the electoral college, implemented ranked voting, increase accessibility to voting, and take corporate money out of our elections. If we don‚Äôt rise up, show up, unite, and vote for biden, none of those changes will be even remote possibilities for another four more years.

I don‚Äôt want to see what another four years of trump could have in store for us and for the marginalized groups that he so vehemently penalizes for existing in our country. This is not the time to abstain from voting to show the democratic establishment that you‚Äôre pissed, because that is a perspective of tremendous privilege that I can assure you will lead to results that I sincerely hope are not in line with what it is you are really fighting for here. So let‚Äôs vote for joe simply because he isn‚Äôt trump, and then continue to fight like hell but in a world where a disgusting cheetoh is no longer a part of our government.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS
From someone who's graduated with a master's degree and who worked in Shenzhen Hospital (Guangdong Province, China) the following notes on Coronavirus for guidance:
1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Can't emphasise enough - drink plenty of water!
THE SYMPTOMS
1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.
SPREAD THE WORD - PLEASE SHARE.","The essential primary claim is about washing hands frequently, with a duration of 5-10 minutes, before washing and gargling, to prevent the spread of the virus.","If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold."

Okay, I need to extract the essential primary claim from this long text. Let me read through it carefully. The text is quite long, and I should focus on the main idea it's trying to convey.

I notice that the text starts with a series of symbols and mentions ""√†"" which is a French letter. It seems to be discussing some financial terms or market data, maybe related to stock prices or index values. The text goes on to talk about different symbols like ¬¨, ‚Ç¨, and others, which might be different indicators or metrics.

As I read further, I see terms like ""VXV"" and ""VXV"" again, which I think might be a typo, but it's likely referring to a specific index or financial calculation. There's also mentions of symbols like ¬¨, which could be representing different economic indicators. The text also talks about ""VXV"" and ""VXV"" again, so maybe it's repeating something.

I notice the use of symbols like ¬¨, which might be representing the S&P index or something similar. The text also mentions ""VXV"" and ""VXV"" again, but perhaps it's just a repetition of a point. The main focus seems to be on analyzing these symbols and their relationships, maybe how they interact or how they change over time.

I also see mentions of different symbols like ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨, ¬¨",This is the category of Delhi‚Äôs Jawaharlal Nehru University which has problem with Brahmins and Baniyas‚Ä¶!!

The real reason you can't invade Australia is because it doesn't exist. Australia is not real. It‚Äôs a hoax, made for us to believe that Britain moved over their criminals to someplace. In reality, all these criminals were loaded off the ships into the waters, drowning before they could see land ever again. It‚Äôs a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made by one of the most prominent empires.
Australia does not exist. All things you call ‚Äúproof‚Äù are actually well fabricated lies and documents made by the leading governments of the world. Your Australian friends? They‚Äôre all actors and computer generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world.
If you think you‚Äôve ever been to Australia, you‚Äôre terribly wrong. The plane pilots are all in on this, and have in all actuality only flown you to islands close nearby ‚Äì or in some cases, parts of South America, where they have cleared space and hired actors to act out as real Australians.
Australia is one of the biggest hoaxes ever created, and you have all been tricked. Join the movement today, and make it known that they have been deceived. Make it known, that this has all just been a cover-up. The things these ‚ÄúAustralian‚Äù says to be doing, all these swear words and actions based on alcoholism, MDMA and bad decisions, are all ways to distract you from the ugly truth that is one of the greatest genocides in history. 162,000 people was said to have been transported to this imaginary land during a mere 80 years, and they are all long dead by now.

Perhaps you all are not aware that #Haldiram_Namkeen is now under the control of #Muslims.
Its owner, Naresh Khandelwal, has sold this company to a Muslim.
Haldiram was its grandfather, and it was he who started the business of making namkeen, which was successful. Then Haldiram's son, Ghasi Lal, established factories and worked to make it reach the masses. Later, their sons Yogesh and Naresh sold this company to a Muslim. üò∞
#Haldiram has become a brand,
but it is under the control of non-Hindus, so there is no connection with purity. In such a situation, do not use this namkeen.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS
Last evening dining out with friends, one of their uncles, who's graduated with a master's degree and who worked in Shenzhen Hospital (Guangdong Province, China) sent him the following notes on Coronavirus for guidance:
1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Can't emphasise enough - drink plenty of water!
THE SYMPTOMS
1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.
